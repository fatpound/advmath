> A view of a space with full of randomly generated hollow stars
- Stars rotate around their centres clockwise or counter-clockwise
- Stars never collide
- Stars have different flare counts, colours, centre coordinates, rotation speeds, inner and outer radiuses, colour changing frequencies (fading to white and back), radius increasing & decreasing amplitudes and frequencies.
- Use the mouse to drag
- Use the mouse wheel to zoom in or out
- Use Q and E to rotate the space around the screen centre
